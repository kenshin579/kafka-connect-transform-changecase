== Overview

This project attempts provides additional SMTs that are not readily available for use.

== Deployment

. Build
Download the project code and perform a maven build
+
----
mvn clean package
----
+
. Copy the resulting jar file to kafka connect `plugin.path` directory
. Restart connect.
Transformation classes defined in this project will be picked by the connect worker after restart.

== Usage

=== ConvertCase
. Operates only on KEY and VALUE of kafka record.
. Use `convert.from.to` to convert the case of the incoming field name.
Supports following conversions.
+
|===
|**Incoming**|**Outgoing**|value|Comments
|snake_case|camelCase|snakeunderscore2camel|From snake case with underscore (_)
|snake-case|camelCase|snakehyphen2came|From snake case with hyphen (-)
|camelCase|snake_case|camel2snakeunderscore|To snake case with underscore (_)
|camelCase|snake-case|camel2snakehyphen|To snake case with hyphen (-)
|===
. Use `whitelist` to whitelist fields (comma-separated) for conversion.
This limits conversion of those fields only. Rest of the fields (except structs) are ignored.
. Use `blacklist` to blacklist fields (comma-separated) for conversion.
This filters out fields for conversion. Rest of the fields (except structs) are considered for conversion.
. Use `noop` to ignore conversion of those fields.
